# Cerner_2^5 Day 10 Submission

First time with Rust code, and it was pretty intuitive. I like how parenthesis are not really needed for if checks and looping.

How to Run:

1.  Have [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) installed and added to path.
    1.  Or you can use [this online compiler](https://play.rust-lang.org/). (Slight adjustments to the code may be needed to get it to run.)
2.  Save `SubsequentString.rs` locally and navigate to the root folder
3.  Compile scala with `rustc SubsequentString.rs`
4.  Run program with `.\SubsequentString`
    1.  Compiling the code will create a .exe file that is used to run the program.
