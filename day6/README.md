# Cerner_2^5 Day 6 Submission

First time with scala code. Its not to bad. using paranthesis instead of square brackets for arrays and such would take some getting used to.

How to Run:

1.  Have [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) installed and added to path.
2.  Save `RunningSum.scala` locally and navigate to the root folder
4.  Compile scala with `scalac RunningSum.scala`
5.  Run program with `scala RunningSum.scala`
    1.  Program is on an infinite loop so you will need to `Crtl + Z` in terminal to end.
