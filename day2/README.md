# Cerner_2^5 Day 2 Submission


I've decided to stick with recursion and user input again for today, and went with a recursive power calculator in Java.


How to Run:
 1. Have [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html) installed and added to path.
    - Or paste the program directly into this [online Java compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/).
 2. Navigate to the directory where 'FindPower.java' is stored locally
 3. Execute the follow: `javac FindPower.java && java FindPower`
