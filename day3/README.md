# Cerner_2^5 Day 3 Submission

First time right Ruby code, so I thought I'd pair it with work with some F1 data. The program will print out the top 10 of the current drivers standing.

How to Run:
 1. Have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed and added to path.
    - Could use choco with `choco install ruby` or any other equivalent software to choco (like brew)
    - JSON gem should be included with newer versions of ruby, but this command may be needed to install JSON: `gem install json`.
 2. Navigate to the directory where 'currentF1Standings.rb' is stored locally
 3. Execute 'currentF1Standings.rb' with `ruby Current_F1_Driver_Standings.rb`
