# Cerner_2^5 Day 5 Submission

First time writing Go code. Intial thoughts are that the syntax is a bit more involved than some of the other languages, so its not as easy to pick up right off the start.

How to Run:

1.  Have [Go Lang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and added to path.
2.  Save `KlingonTranslator.go` under a "root/main" directory structure.
3.  Navigate to the main folder
4.  Run with `go run KlingonTranslator.go`
